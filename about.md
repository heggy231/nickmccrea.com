I'm a software engineer, writer, and editor from Miami, Florida.

I've worked at web startups, lived abroad as a digital nomad, and attempted a couple of my own ventures. Find my full CV on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickmccrea/){:target="_blank"}.

I built [Sobot Rimulator](https://github.com/nmccrea/sobot-rimulator){:target="_blank"}, an autonomous robot simulator and programming tool.

My [machine learning tutorial](https://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/machine-learning-theory-an-introductory-primer#obtain-only-eye-opening-engineers){:target="_blank"} and [robot programming tutorial](https://www.toptal.com/robotics/programming-a-robot-an-introductory-tutorial#obtain-only-eye-opening-engineers){:target="_blank"} are ranked at the top of Google search results. At [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/blog#obtain-only-eye-opening-engineers){:target="_blank"} I edited numerous popular articles on a wide range of technical topics.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the [University of Florida](http://www.ufl.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

I love all things space travel, artificial intelligence, and the future. I am excited to be a part of the burgeoning tech community here in Miami.

When I'm not at work, you can find me at the improv or the open mic, exploring Miami history, playing basketball, o mejorando mi espa√±ol.
