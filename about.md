I'm a software engineer and website-haver from Miami, Florida.

I'm currently a Senior Engineer at Deep Blocks, building next-level software for real estate development. I've worked at a few startups, lived abroad as a digital nomad, and attempted a couple ventures of my own. If any of that interests you all the deets are on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickmccrea/){:target="_blank"}.

Here's something kind of cool I've built: [_Sobot Rimulator_](https://github.com/nmccrea/sobot-rimulator){:target="_blank"} is an autonomous robot simulator and programming tool. Also my [machine learning tutorial](https://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/machine-learning-theory-an-introductory-primer#obtain-only-eye-opening-engineers){:target="_blank"} and [robot programming tutorial](https://www.toptal.com/robotics/programming-a-robot-an-introductory-tutorial#obtain-only-eye-opening-engineers){:target="_blank"} have done pretty well. At [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/blog#obtain-only-eye-opening-engineers){:target="_blank"} I edited numerous popular articles on a wide range of technical topics.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the [University of Florida](http://www.ufl.edu/){:target="_blank"} in 2010. I'm into space travel and planning the cities of the future. I'm also kind of a big Miami history nerd. I have a fat cat named Mr. Snuggles.
