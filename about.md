I'm a software engineer, writer, and editor in Miami, Florida.

I've worked at web startups, been a digital nomad, and dabbled in entrepreneurship.

I built [Sobot Rimulator](https://github.com/nmccrea/sobot-rimulator){:target="_blank"}, an autonomous robot programming tool.

I've written about [machine learning](https://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/machine-learning-theory-an-introductory-primer#obtain-only-eye-opening-engineers){:target="_blank"}, [robotics](https://www.toptal.com/robotics/programming-a-robot-an-introductory-tutorial#obtain-only-eye-opening-engineers){:target="_blank"}, and [digital nomad life](https://www.toptal.com/freelance/a-digital-nomad-adventure-traveling-with-hacker-paradise#obtain-only-eye-opening-engineers){:target="_blank"}, and edited articles on a wide range of technical topics.

I was born and raised in Miami. I've also lived and worked in Chicago, Illinois, and Bangkok, Thailand.

I love all things space travel, robotics, and the future.

Practico hablar esp√±ol todos los dias. I'm a coffee snob. When I'm not at work, you can find me at the improv, nerding out about space travel, or playing video games.
