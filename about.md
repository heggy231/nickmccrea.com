I'm a software engineer, writer, and editor from Miami, Florida.

I've worked at web startups, lived abroad as a digital nomad, and attempted a couple of my own ventures. Find my full CV on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickmccrea/){:target="_blank"}.

I built [Sobot Rimulator](https://github.com/nmccrea/sobot-rimulator){:target="_blank"}, an autonomous robot simulator and programming tool.

My [machine learning tutorial](https://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/machine-learning-theory-an-introductory-primer#obtain-only-eye-opening-engineers){:target="_blank"} and [robot programming tutorial](https://www.toptal.com/robotics/programming-a-robot-an-introductory-tutorial#obtain-only-eye-opening-engineers){:target="_blank"} are ranked at the top of Google search results. At [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/blog#obtain-only-eye-opening-engineers){:target="_blank"} I edited numerous popular articles on a wide range of technical topics.

I have a [BS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science){:target="_blank"} in [CE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_engineering){:target="_blank"} from [UF](http://www.ufl.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

I love all things space travel, artificial intelligence, and the future. I am excited to be a part of the burgeoning tech community here in Miami.

When I'm not at work, you can find me at the improv or the open mic, exploring Miami history, or playing basketball. Yo hablo algo español, y más cada día.
